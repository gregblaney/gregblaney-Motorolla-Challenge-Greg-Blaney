# Automation Coding Test

This project contains a completed version of the web app from [Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/tour-of-heroes)

The goal of this tech test is:
- Install and configure the Cypress Framework
- Create a basic e2e test of one the key application paths
- Create a component test for one of the application components
- Update the readme.md file on how to run the cypress test suite
- Ensure the test results are documented

Bonus Points:
- Add an additional hard coded hero

You should clone the repo to your local machine and not commit any chnages back to source control

To Run The Code:

Firstly ensure you have the correct dependencies installed on your local machine, assuming you are running Windows this [Guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows) provides the steps.

Once you have cloned the repo and are in the correct directory run the following commands:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

The application can then be accessed on your local machine at the following url:

`http://localhost:4200`
